# 🤖 AI & Data Science Playground

This repository is my **playground for exploring Data Science, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)**.  
It contains hands-on experiments, exploratory notebooks, and small projects that cover a wide range of topics — from data preprocessing and visualization to training neural networks.

The main goal of this repo is not to create production-ready systems, but to **learn, experiment, and document my journey** in AI and Data Science.
